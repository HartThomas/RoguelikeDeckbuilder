*** Roguelike Deckbuilder â€” Godot 4.4 Project ***

This is a deckbuilding roguelike game developed using the Godot 4.4 engine. The game combines strategic card play with classic roguelike elements.

I created this project to learn game development with Godot and gain hands-on experience using an object-oriented programming language (GDScript). It served as a personal study in managing game architecture, state machines, turn-based combat, and procedural content in a modular, scalable way.

***Gameplay Overview***

At the start, choose your alignment, which determines your initial deck.

Enter a series of turn-based battles where you draw cards each turn and play them using limited energy.

Defeat enemies to earn new cards, and upgrades.

Your goal is to progress as far as possible before being defeated â€” each run is different!
