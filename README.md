# Roguelike-Ideas

Think Slay the Spire. The original idea is based on the player having a weapon in hand while attempting to beat the game. Most of the cards that you played would be editted by the weapon you were holding in some way eg.:

- if holding a sword all of your attacks deal 2 more damage
- if holding a dagger every other attack gets played twice
- if holding a spear at end of turn deal x damage where x is the number of attacks played that turn
- if holding [unknown] each card costs double for each card you played before it but has double effect for each card played before it

The char could also hold something in the off hand as well:

- shield would add 2 to the block of each defensive card
- holy symbol would prevent any non-attack damage
- parry dagger would reflect a percent of an attack sustained

Instead of travelling 1 floor at a time and dealing with whatever is there, we could give the player more autonomy in making decisions so each floor would have 3 different monsters you could fight, and also 1 shop you could visit(blacksmith, leather goods etc.) AND 1 boss to fight. This way the user chooses which they want to do and the less monsters you fight before the boss the higher the reward for fighting the boss. This would create an interesting decision making process for the user, weighing up a potential price. After the boss was fought you would move on to the next floor.

Use all the above but instead of cards in hand you have lines which eg. deal 1 damage. After each battle you have a chance to combine these lines to create shapes. You could start with 3 straight lines and 2 curved lines in your deck. 2 curves could create a circle which eg. create a bubble around the player to prevent the next damage, or 3 straight lines could create a triangle which eg. deals 3 times 3 damage.
Another potential starter card could be a vertex(corner) and an upgrade could be that the vertex gets sharper thus dealing more damage.
There could be a way for the user to create the shapes instead if they wanted to draw them themselves

Another idea is you could have a few types of effort(mana) instead of having multiple mana eg. physical effort plays normal cards like hit/block but mental effort plays cards like forget.
